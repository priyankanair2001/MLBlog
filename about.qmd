Hello, my name is Priyanka Nair, but you can call me Priya. I graduated from Virginia Tech with a Bachelor's in Computer Science in May 2023. I am currently working towards my Master's in Computer Science. This blog is to showcase what I've learned in my Machine Learning class. My favorite color is (obviously) purple.
